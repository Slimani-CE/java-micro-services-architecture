# Java micro-services architecture


## Overview
Thi project is a Java Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of various web service technologies such as REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and gRPC. The application will be built as a microservice using JPA for data persistence and H2 as an in-memory database. It will expose a variety of APIs for managing user accounts and demonstrate how to use these web service technologies in a single application. The project will also involve generating and testing Swagger documentation, utilizing Spring Data Rest and projections, creating DTOs and Mappers, and implementing a Service layer for the microservice. Finally, a GraphQL Web service will be created to showcase the usage of GraphQL in a microservice architecture.
